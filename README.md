Here are some of the things I am learning about in this course:

* The basics of embedded systems, such as architecture, hardware, software, and programming.
* The specific challenges of real-time programming.
* How to design and implement real-time systems.

* Rate Monotonic theory and policies
* Methods of Rate Monontoic analysis
* Real-time system design techniques
* Engineering principles for allocating functionality and services to hardware, firmware or software implementation
